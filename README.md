This is a columination of most of the projects completed in the Spring 2021 C/C++ Programming class.

Throughout the semester we worked on various projects and fill-in pieces of code. The main projects I put the most time into are Tic-Tac-Toe, Pizza.cpp, and Final.c. I am most proud of my Tic-Tac-Toe game though. The rest were either fill-in files or I recieved help in some form of fashion during lab hours or through the class chat. This semester was rather fun, especially considering there was no in-person enviroment for us due to COVID and uncertainty about the virus.
