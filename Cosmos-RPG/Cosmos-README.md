#### Instructions on compiling and playing the game
###### Created By ~~Redacted~~

+------+

First things first, I would like to say thank you for showing an interest in this RPG. It is still a work in progress and probably will be for eternity. Check back monthly for new updates and expansions on the game. Each update will require a full game restart unless I can figure out a way to save progress/results upon exiting the program. 

The game was built in C, which means you will need to compile the code yourself on your own machine. This also allows me to get the games to you without having to be a verified publisher. I compiled this game with Visual Studio 2019 CLI version. You could probably use another compiler but for your best chance of success I would suggest that compiler. It is important to note that you must compile all the .c files at once or else the game will not function properly. For example, in the current version 0.0.0001 you would need to do cl /cosmos.c /choose.c ... thise means you are taking the two seperate .c files and creating one .exe file from them. 

When you first start, you will be greeted and asked for a name. This name is not stored anywhere, pick anything you want :). Next you will be shown instuctions, those same instructions can be found here:
"When you see [ X ] followed by options, this means you must choose which path you want to take."

What this means is you must select the option you want and the press your return/enter key to continue. Pretty straight forward so far, right?
